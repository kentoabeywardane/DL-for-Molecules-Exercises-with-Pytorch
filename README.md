# DL for Molecules Exercises with PyTorch
Doing selected exercises from "Deep Learning for Molecules and Materials" (https://dmol.pub/index.html) by Andrew D. White using PyTorch as my introduction to PyTorch and using DL for molecules.

This book that I am reading uses Jax as its primary deep learning library. I learned how to use TensorFlow in my deep learning class during my senior year of undergraduate studies. However, since most research in the field of deep learning uses PyTorch, I wanted to learn this library as well. My goal is to pursue research in applying machine learning methods to the field of drug discovery. As such, this resource served as a good introduction to learning how utilize molecular data with DL.
